# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 09/04/2025

This extension does not collect, transmit, or share any personal information with the developer or third parties.

## Data Storage
The only data stored by this extension is the API token you choose to provide.  
This token is stored locally in your browser’s local storage and is never sent to the extension developer or any third parties.  
It is only used to authenticate requests you explicitly make to the TinyURL API to generate the shortened URL.

## Data Sharing
No data is collected or transmitted to the developer.  
Requests made using your API token go directly from your browser to the TinyURL API.

## Permissions
The extension may request limited Chrome permissions (such as `storage` and `tabs`) in order to store your token locally and read the current page URL.  
These permissions are only used for the extension’s core functionality.

## Contact
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you may open an issue on the GitHub repo.
