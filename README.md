# TinyURL Chrome Extension
A bare bones extension to add your current URL to your clipboard as a TinyURL with a click. 

# Setup
Once the extension is installed, you will need to get a TinyURL API token and add it to the extension:
1. Go to [this link](https://tinyurl.com/app/settings/api) (create an account if you don't already have one first) and generate + copy an API token.
2. Pin the extension:

3. Right click the extension icon and select "Extension Options":

4. Paste your API token into the input field and click "Save Token":

The extension should now be ready to be used. You should see a green checkmark on successful TinyURL generation.
